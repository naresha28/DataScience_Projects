## Data Science Projects

As part of my data science learning journey, I have worked on various real-world datasets to analyze them and obtain meaningful results.

Here are some of them:

### Analysis of I-94 Freeway Traffic Volume 
- This project involved analyzing traffic volume data from the I-94 freeway in Minnesota and identifying trends and patterns in the data using and data visualization techniques.

### Predicting House Prices

- In this project, I developed a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict house prices based on key features such as living area, number of rooms, and garage area. The model utilized linear regression method.

### Analyzing COVID RNA Sequences

- The project involved analyzing the RNA sequences of COVID, delta, and omicron variants through exploring sequence metadata, and conducting sequence alignment to identify points of mismatching.
