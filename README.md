## Data Science Projects

As part of my data science learning journey, I have worked on various real-world datasets to analyze them and obtain meaningful results.

Here are some of them:

### [Analysis of I-94 Freeway Traffic Volume](https://github.com/naresha28/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/I94_traffic/I94_traffic_indicators.ipynb) 
- This project involved analyzing traffic volume data from the I-94 freeway in Minnesota and identifying trends and patterns in the data using and data visualization techniques.

Skills Used : **Numpy, Pandas, Matplolib, Data Analysis**

### [Predicting House Prices](https://github.com/naresha28/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/House_Prices/house_prices.ipynb)

- In this project, I developed a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict house prices based on key features such as living area, number of rooms, and garage area. The model utilized linear regression method.

Skills Used: **Machine Learning, Linear Regression, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas**

### [Analyzing COVID RNA Sequences](https://github.com/naresha28/DataScience_Projects/blob/main/Covid_Analysis/covid_analysis.ipynb)

- The project involved analyzing the RNA sequences of COVID, delta, and omicron variants through exploring sequence metadata, and conducting sequence alignment to identify points of mismatching.

Skills used: **Numpy, Pandas, BioPython, RNA Sequnecing**

### [Predicting Weather](https://github.com/naresha28/DataScience_Projects/tree/main/Predicting_Weather)

- In this project I developed a model for predicting the next day's weather using crucial factors such as precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature.

Skills used: **Pandas, Matplotlib, Machine Learning, Ridge Regression**


### 

- In this project, I demonstrate SQL skills for querying data from the factbook database
